# Introduction

The project compares 06 widely used search algorithms for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning in terms of convergence rate and running time. Those consist of
* Random search
* Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process
* Bayesian Optimization with Random Forests
* Bayesian Optimization with Gradient Boosting
* Annealing Search
* Tree-structured Parzen Estimators Search

The project employes GradientBoostingClassifier to identify patients in the breast cancer dataset from Sklearn. While 62.7% of patients are healthy, accuracy is used as a predictive performance metric
